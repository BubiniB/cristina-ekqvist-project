# Cristina Ekqvist - Personal resume website

Cristina Ekqvist is my professional resume website that aspires to showcase my new skillsets in the field of coding and at the same time give a short and concise summary of my professional background. This site is primarily targeted towards potential new employers and is supposed to be updated as my skills improve and more is to showcase.

## Features 

On my webpage we have different feauters, such as a navigation bar and a footer, which are present on all pages. This lets users navigate easily on all pages and know exactly where they are. The footer gives users the opportunity to connect professionally with me on LinkedIn. 

There is a landing page with a background image and a small introduction, to let new visitors get an idea of what this page is about and who I am. There is a table for my professional career and former education to summarize my skillsets. I have created a mock-up contact form, which will be updated as I am becoming more profficient.

The portfolio page is as of now empty due to pressing deadlines but will be updated as more projects will be completed. My aspiration is to provide a screenshot of each project, a short description of each project and a link, which will allow visitors to check out other webpages that I have created.

### Existing Features

- __Navigation Bar__

  - My navigation bar is present on all pages and includes links to Home, Experience, Portfolio and Contact. Additionally visitors will be able to get back to the landing page when clicking on the logo.
  - There is a hover function, which allows visitors to see which page they are about to visit.
  - The page visitors are currently at is underlined so that they know where they are.
  - The navigation bar is fully responsive and changes when looking at the page on smaller devices.

- __The landing page__

  - The landing page has a background image to build contrasts with the webpage's color scheme and to give a more harmonius feel. For me it was important to have a landing page that does not overwhelm visitors and is easy on the eye and to understand. 

- __Welcome - section__
  - There is a "Welcome" section, which very briefly states who I am as a means of marketing myself. This section is placed under the logo to draw the attention of visitors.

- __Get to know me! - section__

  - This section is supposed to be a short introduction of my professional self and of what this webpage is all about. The intention is that visitors will be curious to explore the rest of the page after taking in the information and hopefully try to make contact with me. I have chosen to center the section and give it breathing room on wider screens so that it is easier for visitors to read and process the information.

- __Personal - section__

  - The "Personal" section is supposed to give a little bit of personal information for those visitors who might be interested. It is a way of making me more approachable at the same time as it is not supposed to take away any focus of my main goal: keeping it professional. As it is not the main focus of the page, I have chosen to put this section in right bottom corner of the page on wider screens (alternatively last in order of all sections). This way I can keep symmetry on the landing page.

- __The Footer__ 

  - The footer is supposed to be a constant reminder of my personal contact information. Should a visitor be interested in taking contact after reading information on any of the pages, it should be easy for them to do just that. This is why the footer shows on every page.
  - The footer includes also a link to my professional social media account (LinkedIn) in case visitors prefer to reach out to me on that platform instead. This way they can also get a chance to look at my resume on another format.

- __Experience__

  - The "Experience" page is supposed to give visitors insight into my prior career and education. It acts as a summarized CV, showing a little bit of my skills prior learning how to code. The aim of this page is to further market myself by giving the standard written information.
  - The page is divided in 3 tables:
    * "My CV": a classic condensed CV,
    * "Skills and experience": a short summary of everything I have worked with/know,
    * "Education": showing that I have a university degree before starting a new career.

- __Portfolio__

  - This page is under construction and omitted for this project due to pressing deadlines. The aim is to showcase my newly developed skills and catch visitors attention. I have added a temporary background image to show that more is yet to come.

- __Contact__

  - The "Contact" page is supposed to be a showcase of me knowing how to create contact forms. The aim is to have it working fully by letting visitors send their contact information, providing an additional way of reaching out.
  - I chose to add a background image to improve the look of the page, keeping the color scheme in mind.

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement

- As mentioned before, I would like to add my future projects on the portfolio page. I would like build a little showcase of all the projects that lets visitors interact with each project.
- I would like to be able to create a "working" contact form, which can send the information visitors leave directly to me.

## Testing 

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your project’s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.


### Validator Testing 

- HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fcode-institute-org.github.io%2Flove-running-2.0%2Findex.html)
- CSS
  - No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fvalidator.w3.org%2Fnu%2F%3Fdoc%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcode-institute-org.github.io%252Flove-running-2.0%252Findex.html&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en#css)

### Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed. 

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub) 

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.

## Credits 

In this section you need to reference where you got your content, media and extra help from. It is common practice to use code from other repositories and tutorials, however, it is important to be very specific about these sources to avoid plagiarism. 

You can break the credits section up into Content and Media, depending on what you have included in your project.

## Other General Project Advice

Below you will find a couple of extra tips that may be helpful when completing your project. Remember that each of these projects will become part of your final portfolio so it’s important to allow enough time to showcase your best work! 

- One of the most basic elements of keeping a healthy commit history is with the commit message. When getting started with your project, read through [this article](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) by Chris Beams on How to Write  a Git Commit Message 
  - Make sure to keep the messages in the imperative mood 

- When naming the files in your project directory, make sure to consider meaningful naming of files, point to specific names and sections of content.
  - For example, instead of naming an image used ‘image1.png’ consider naming it ‘landing_page_img.png’. This will ensure that there are clear file paths kept. 

- Do some extra research on good and bad coding practices, there are a handful of useful articles to read, consider reviewing the following list when getting started:
  - [Writing Your Best Code](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/writing-your-best-code/)
  - [HTML & CSS Coding Best Practices](https://medium.com/@inceptiondj.info/html-css-coding-best-practice-fadb9870a00f)
  - [Google HTML/CSS Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.html#General)

Getting started with your Portfolio Projects can be daunting, planning your project can make it a lot easier to tackle, take small steps to reach the final outcome and enjoy the process!
